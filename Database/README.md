# Database Set Up
This folder contains the files for setting up the database of the project. When starting up the program, the files should be run in the order that
they are assigned. For instance, "01-CreateTables.sql" should run first. Then, "02-InsertTestData.sql" should run second, and so on. Eventually, when in production "02-InsertTestData.sql" should be removed or replaced.
