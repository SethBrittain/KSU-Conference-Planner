# Wireframes Folder
This folder contains the images of the wireframes and diagrams used in the project's wiki. The wireframes were created with the intent to be reusable for others to use. There is a consistent theme so that the wireframes have a cohesive look. Interactable objects like buttons were made with a consistent look so as to not confuse the user on what is interactable and what is not. When creating these wireframes, they were created with the type of user that would use them in mind.

**Please refer to the wiki to see how the images stored in this folder will be used in the application.**
